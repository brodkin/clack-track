# Hot Take Subjects Taxonomy Design

## Design Principles

1. **Broad, not specific**: "dogs" not "chihuahuas barking at mailmen"
2. **Creative freedom**: Each subject allows many possible angles
3. **Not already hot takes**: Avoid "pineapple on pizza" style topics
4. **Mundane/everyday**: Keep topics trivial and harmless
