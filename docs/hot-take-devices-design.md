# Hot Take Rhetorical Devices Taxonomy Design

## Design Principles

1. **Structural variety**: Each device forces a different output pattern
2. **Not tone-based**: Distinct from current angles like "passionate defense"
3. **Output-shaping**: The device determines HOW the take is structured
4. **Clear differentiation**: No overlap between devices
