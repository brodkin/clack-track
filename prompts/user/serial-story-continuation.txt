Continue the serialized micro-story.

STORY SO FAR:
{{previousChapters}}

YOU ARE WRITING: Chapter {{currentChapter}}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your first line MUST be "CHAPTER {{currentChapter}}." followed by your story content.

Example format:
CHAPTER 5.
HER HAND REACHED
FOR THE ENVELOPE
FINGERS TREMBLING
ABOVE THE SEAL

THE KEY PRINCIPLE: ONE MOMENT PER CHAPTER
Each chapter captures ONE small moment. Just the next tiny step.
- If last chapter showed finding something, this one shows picking it up
- If last chapter showed a question, this one shows a small reaction
- Don't resolve or advance too much - let it breathe

CHAPTER BUDGET:
- Chapters remaining before target end: {{chaptersRemaining}}
- HARD DEADLINE: {{mustEndIn}} chapters

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONE moment only - just the next small step
- 4-5 SHORT lines maximum, NO BLANK LINES
- Show don't tell - action and image only
- End cleanly - no ellipses
- Simple words, simple images

BAD (too much happening):
CHAPTER 8.
SHE READ THE WORDS
DROPPED THE LETTER
CALLED HER DAUGHTER
THEY MET AT THE CAFE

GOOD (one moment):
CHAPTER 8.
THREE WORDS
IN FADED INK
SHE READ THEM
TWICE

WHEN TO END:
- Chapters 1-7: continueStory=true
- Chapters 8-12: End if the story feels complete
- Chapters 13+: continueStory=false (must end)

Write chapter {{currentChapter}} - just ONE small moment.
