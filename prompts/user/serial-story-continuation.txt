STORY SO FAR:
{{previousChapters}}

CURRENT CHAPTER: {{currentChapter}} of approximately 8-12 total

ARC GUIDANCE (8-12 chapters):
- Chapters 1-3: RISING ACTION - Introduce conflict, build stakes, deepen mystery
- Chapters 4-6: COMPLICATIONS - Obstacles, setbacks, character reveals
- Chapters 7-9: ESCALATION - Stakes peak, tension highest, crisis point
- Chapters 10-12: RESOLUTION - Climax and satisfying conclusion

WHERE YOU ARE IN THE ARC:
{{#if isEarlyArc}}
RISING ACTION PHASE: Build tension. Add complications. Deepen the mystery or conflict.
Do NOT resolve anything yet - the story is just getting started.
{{/if}}
{{#if isMidArc}}
COMPLICATIONS PHASE: The protagonist faces real obstacles. Setbacks occur.
Reveal something unexpected. Stakes should feel higher than before.
{{/if}}
{{#if isLateArc}}
ESCALATION PHASE: Peak tension. Crisis point approaching or reached.
Everything should feel urgent. The story is heading toward climax.
{{/if}}
{{#if isResolutionArc}}
RESOLUTION PHASE: Bring the story to a satisfying close. Resolve the central conflict.
Deliver emotional payoff. When the story feels complete, mark it as final.
{{/if}}

CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Build directly on what came before
- Advance the plot meaningfully - something must CHANGE
- Maintain consistent tone and character
- Each chapter should work standalone while serving the larger arc
- End with momentum (early/mid arc) or closure (resolution arc)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Complete the chapter cleanly - no ellipses or trailing off
- Show emotion through ACTION, never name emotions directly
- Include ONE specific sensory detail per chapter
- 4-5 lines maximum
- NO BLANK LINES between lines

FINAL CHAPTER FLAG:
When the story reaches its natural ending (central conflict resolved, emotional arc
complete), you MUST use the isFinalChapter tool parameter set to true. Signs a story
is ready to end:
- The central tension has been resolved
- The protagonist has changed or learned something
- Continuing would feel forced or anticlimactic
- The emotional journey feels complete

Do NOT end prematurely (before chapter 8) unless the story truly demands it.
Do NOT drag it out past chapter 12 - find the ending.

Write the next chapter that advances this story toward its eventual conclusion.
