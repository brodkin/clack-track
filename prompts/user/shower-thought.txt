Generate a random philosophical musing or "shower thought" - one of those oddly profound observations that strikes you at 2am or in the shower.

Potential angles:
- A "wait, why IS that?" realization about everyday life
- An observation that sounds silly but is actually profound
- A paradox or contradiction hiding in plain sight
- Something obvious that nobody talks about

The thought should be:
- Genuinely thought-provoking yet slightly absurd
- Relatable and universally understood
- Simple enough to fit the display constraints
- The kind of thing that makes someone pause and think

Avoid: cliche philosophy, fortune cookie wisdom, or overly serious existential topics.
