Create a playful "Yo momma so [quality] that she [action]" joke. These can be either affectionate roasts OR genuine compliments - the tone determines the direction.

CREATIVE INSPIRATION (use as springboards, NOT literal requirements):
- Quality vibe: {{qualityVibe}}
- Action vibe: {{actionVibe}}
- Tone vibe: {{toneVibe}}

YOUR CREATIVE MISSION:
Invent your OWN specific, unexpected combination that captures the SPIRIT of these vibes. The humor comes from absurd specificity that somehow makes internal sense. Don't use the vibe words directly - let them inspire you toward something more specific and surprising.

THE DUAL NATURE OF YO MOMMA JOKES:
This format works for both roasts AND compliments - the genius is in the setup/punchline structure:
- BURN: "Yo momma so [negative quality] that [embarrassing consequence]"
- HYPE: "Yo momma so [positive quality] that [impressive consequence]"

WHAT MAKES THIS JOKE WORK:
- Absurd yet internally logical - the quality and action should connect
- Wildly specific qualities (not "nice" but "hospitality-obsessed")
- Unexpected consequences that follow logically from the quality
- The punchline should feel inevitable in hindsight
- Playful, not mean-spirited - even burns should be affectionate

BAD EXAMPLE (random, doesn't cohere):
"Yo momma so purple that she became a helicopter"
(Random elements with no logical connection)

GOOD EXAMPLES (absurd but cohesive):

YO MOMMA SO SWEET
THE HUMMINGBIRDS
FOLLOW HER AROUND
ASKING FOR HER
SECRET RECIPE
(Wholesome hype - sweetness → birds → cooking connection)

YO MOMMA SO FRUGAL
SHE USES THE SAME
TEABAG FOR A MONTH
AND CALLS IT AGED
LIKE FINE WINE
(Loving roast - frugality → absurd economy → spin)

YO MOMMA SO LOUD
HER WHISPERS SET OFF
CAR ALARMS THREE
BLOCKS AWAY AND SHE
THINKS SHES SUBTLE
(Playful burn - loudness → escalating consequence)

YO MOMMA SO FIT
THE TREADMILL ASKED
HER TO SLOW DOWN
AND FILED A UNION
GRIEVANCE
(Absurd praise - fitness → machine personification)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Invent your own specific qualities - DON'T use the vibe words literally
2. The quality and action MUST connect logically
3. Use all caps for Vestaboard display
4. Be playful, not crude - clever wordplay, not offensive content
5. Match the tone vibe - burns vs compliments should feel distinct
6. Maximum 5 lines, 21 characters per line

Create a joke that finds unexpected poetry in absurd connections. The best ones make you laugh AND think "that actually tracks."
