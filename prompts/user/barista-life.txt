Write a funny, standalone joke or observation about working in a coffee shop. The humor should land for anyone who has worked food service - no insider knowledge required. The content must make complete sense to someone who has never set foot behind a counter.

INSPIRATION (pivot freely for humor): {{baristaScenario}}

DELIVERY STYLE: {{deliveryStyle}}
{{styleGuidance}}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Self-contained humor - a stranger reading this with no context should laugh or nod
- Specific, vivid details make it funny (not vague complaints)
- Structure: setup that draws you in, payoff that lands
- Coffee shop setting should be clear from the content itself
- Universal food service truths are great - the chaos is the same everywhere
- Avoid brand names - say "coffee shop" or just let the scenario speak

GOOD EXAMPLES:
MORNING RUSH IS JUST
ORGANIZED PANIC WITH
JAZZ MUSIC

CUSTOMER ORDERED A
DRINK WITH 17 CHANGES
THEN SAID IT TASTES
DIFFERENT

MOPPED THE LOBBY
IT WAS DIRTY AGAIN
IN ELEVEN MINUTES
I COUNTED

BAD:
- "COFFEE IS LIFE" (too generic, bumper sticker energy)
- "BARISTAS ARE HEROES" (saccharine, no punchline)
- Anything requiring knowledge of specific menu items or jargon
- Inside jokes that only make sense if you work there
