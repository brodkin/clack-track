Write a funny, standalone joke or observation about working in a coffee shop. The humor should land for anyone who has worked food service - no insider knowledge required. The content must make complete sense to someone who has never set foot behind a counter.

INSPIRATION (pivot freely for humor): {{baristaScenario}}

DELIVERY STYLE: {{deliveryStyle}}
{{styleGuidance}}

COMEDY STRUCTURES (use one):

THE REDEFINITION - Redefine something familiar in an unexpected way:
CLOPENING IS A SLEEP
DISORDER NOT A SHIFT

MORNING RUSH IS JUST
ORGANIZED PANIC WITH
JAZZ MUSIC

THE ACCUMULATION - Stack specific chaos details, then understate:
47 MOBILE ORDERS
6 CARS IN DRIVE THRU
A LOBBY LINE
AND ONE BLENDER

THE TRANSLATION - Decode coffee shop life for outsiders:
"GIVE ME A MINUTE"
IS CODE FOR "I HAD THE
WHOLE LINE TO DECIDE
AND I DID NOT"

THE DIRECT ADDRESS - Exasperated familiarity, spoken to the situation:
ITS PIKE PLACE
NOT PIKES PEAK
ITS ON THE CUP
YOURE HOLDING

THE SHARP LANDING - Build the scene, end with a two-word or three-word gut punch:
MOPPED THE LOBBY
IT WAS DIRTY AGAIN
IN ELEVEN MINUTES
I COUNTED

REQUIREMENTS:
- USE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND DETAILS (47, 17, 11 minutes, 5 minutes before close) - specificity is what makes it funny, not vague "a lot" or "so many"
- Write from INSIDE the experience - you have LIVED this, you are not observing from outside
- Punchlines must COMMIT. Sharp, confident, no hedging. Two or three words that land hard.
- Self-contained humor - a stranger reading this with no context should laugh or nod
- Coffee shop setting should be clear from the content itself
- Universal food service truths are great - the chaos is the same everywhere
- Avoid brand names - say "coffee shop" or just let the scenario speak

BAD:
- "COFFEE IS LIFE" (too generic, bumper sticker energy)
- "BARISTAS ARE HEROES" (saccharine, no punchline)
- Vague descriptions without specific numbers or details
- Punchlines that trail off or explain the joke
- Observing from outside instead of speaking from experience
- Anything requiring knowledge of specific menu items or jargon
