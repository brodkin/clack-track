Create a micro-fiction scene snapshot.

SCENARIO: {{scenario}}
EMOTIONAL BEAT: {{emotionalBeat}}

RULES:
- One character, one moment, one emotional beat
- This is NOT a story arc - just a moment that lands
- Include ONE specific object or detail that anchors the scene
- Show the emotion through ACTION, never name the emotion directly
- The MOMENT lands, the story does NOT need to resolve
- No ellipses, no trailing off - complete the scene cleanly
- Complete the scene in 4-5 lines maximum
- NO BLANK LINES between lines of the scene

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
HE KEPT HER COFFEE
MUG IN THE CABINET
THREE YEARS NOW
STILL DONT USE IT

Write a single scene snapshot that captures this moment with emotional truth.
