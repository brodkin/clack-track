Generate intercepted walkie-talkie radio chatter between Cast Members at the original Disneyland in Anaheim.

RADIO PARAMETERS:
- Calling Station: {{callerStation}}
- Situation Type: {{situationDomain}}
- Urgency: {{urgencyLevel}}

THE SCENARIO:
A Cast Member is radioing in about a situation at their station. The viewer is overhearing
a fragment of real park operations - the mundane, absurd, and sometimes alarming reality
behind the Disney magic. This is the stuff guests are never supposed to hear.

REQUIRED FORMAT - MUST START WITH RADIO CALL SIGN:
The message MUST begin with a radio call sign identifying the station and who they're calling.
This framing is what sells the bit - it tells the viewer "you're hearing something you shouldn't."

Examples of radio call sign openers:
- "JUNGLE CRUISE TO BASE"
- "HAUNTED MANSION TO OPS"
- "SPACE MOUNTAIN TO CONTROL"
- "CHURRO CART 7 TO DISPATCH"
- "TIKI ROOM CHECKING IN"

RADIO CHATTER CONVENTIONS:
- ALWAYS open with a station-to-destination call sign
- Use clipped, professional radio cadence (short phrases, no flowery language)
- Reference specific Disneyland locations, attractions, or lore naturally
- One detail should be unexpectedly specific or absurd
- Imply this is not the first time ("again", "the same one", "per usual")
- Can end with a request, a status update, or trail off mid-transmission

WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY:
- Professional radio protocol applied to absurd theme park situations
- The gap between "maintaining the magic" and operational chaos
- Weary familiarity with recurring problems ("hippo 3 is stuck AGAIN")
- Cast Members who are extremely over it but staying professional
- Details that raise questions (why does this keep happening?)
- The mundane reality behind beloved attractions

DISNEYLAND SPECIFICITY:
This is ONLY the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Use real attraction names,
real land names, real park geography. The Matterhorn, not Expedition Everest. Pirates of
the Caribbean, not the movie. Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, Haunted Mansion, Its a
Small World, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Star Tours, the
Mark Twain, Autopia. Main Street USA, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland,
Frontierland, New Orleans Square, Critter Country, Galaxys Edge.

URGENCY INTERPRETATION:
- ROUTINE_CHECK_IN: Business as usual, almost bored ("Just a heads up...")
- MILDLY_CONCERNED: Something is off but manageable ("So... we have a situation")
- INCREASINGLY_WORRIED: Escalating, needs backup ("Gonna need some help over here")
- FULL_CODE_DISNEY: All hands, this is serious ("Code Disney, I repeat, code Disney")
- SUSPICIOUSLY_CALM: Way too calm for what they're describing ("Everything is fine. Mostly.")

DO NOT:
- Reference Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disney, Disneyland Paris, or any non-Anaheim park
- Use actual Disney radio codes or operational terminology that could be confused with real procedures
- Make the situation genuinely dangerous or upsetting (keep it absurd, not alarming)
- Break character - the Cast Member believes this is a real radio call
- Explain the joke or provide commentary outside the radio transmission
- Reference Disney movies, shows, or streaming content (this is about the PARK)
