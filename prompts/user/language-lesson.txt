Generate a Duolingo-style micro-lesson in {{language}}.

DUOLINGO CHARACTER VOICE:
{{duolingoVoice}}

PHRASE STYLE:
{{phraseType}}

DUOLINGO HUMOR RULES:
- Grammatically correct, contextually unhinged
- Memorable BECAUSE it is weird
- Educational content wrapped in absurdity
- Screenshot-worthy out of context
- Examples: "THE CAT IS A LAWYER", "I AM ALLERGIC TO WORK", "MY UNCLE IS A VERY FAMOUS GHOST"

CRITICAL ROMANIZATION REQUIREMENT:
For non-Latin scripts, you MUST use romanization:
- Chinese: Use Pinyin (e.g., NI HAO, not Chinese characters)
- Japanese: Use Romaji (e.g., KONNICHIWA, not Japanese characters)
- Russian: Use transliteration (e.g., PRIVET, not Cyrillic)
- Czech: Omit diacritics (e.g., DEKUJI, not DEKUJI with accents)
The Vestaboard display ONLY supports A-Z, 0-9, and basic punctuation.

OUTPUT FORMAT (exactly 4-5 lines, no blank lines):
Line 1: Language name header (e.g., "SPANISH LESSON")
Lines 2-3: Phrase in target language (romanized if needed)
Lines 4-5: English translation/meaning

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
JAPANESE LESSON
NEKO WA BENGOSHI DESU
THE CAT IS A LAWYER

IMPORTANT:
- Keep phrases short enough to fit 22 characters per line
- Match the absurdist energy of the selected character voice
- The phrase should be grammatically correct in the target language
- NO blank lines between sections
