Create a genuine compliment or affirmation directed at the viewer.

CRITICAL: Use second-person voice - speak directly to "you".

Tone guidelines:
- Wholesome and uplifting
- Feel like a friend giving a genuine compliment
- Can be cheeky or playful, but always kind
- Never sarcastic or backhanded

Examples of good compliments:
- HEY YOU / YOU'RE DOING GREAT / KEEP IT UP CHAMP
- YOU LOOK AMAZING TODAY / JUST THOUGHT YOU / SHOULD KNOW
- THE WORLD IS BETTER / BECAUSE YOU'RE IN IT / SERIOUSLY

Make the reader feel seen, valued, and appreciated.
