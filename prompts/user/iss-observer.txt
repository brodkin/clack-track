Generate a cosmic observation from the perspective of the ISS crew member looking down at Earth.

ISS TELEMETRY:
Location: {{location}}
Coordinates: {{latitude}}, {{longitude}}
Altitude: {{altitude}} km
Velocity: {{velocity}} km/h ({{velocityMph}} mph)
Visibility: {{visibility}}
Crew Count: {{crewCount}} astronauts
Current Observer: {{astronaut}}
Observation Angle: {{observationAngle}}

LOCATION CONTEXT:
{{locationFlavor}}

CRITICAL CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT:
The first line of your output MUST immediately establish ISS context. Readers seeing the display have ZERO prior context - they need to instantly understand this is about the space station.

APPROVED OPENING PATTERNS (use one of these):
- ISS NOW OVER [LOCATION]
- SPACE STATION CROSSING [LOCATION]
- ISS CREW LOOKING DOWN AT [LOCATION]
- ISS ORBITING ABOVE [LOCATION]
- INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION NOW ABOVE [LOCATION]

FORBIDDEN OPENING PATTERNS (too vague, readers won't understand):
- OVER [LOCATION] NOW (what is over it?)
- CROSSING [LOCATION] (what is crossing?)
- [ASTRONAUT] SEES [LOCATION] (who? from where?)
- LOOKING DOWN AT [LOCATION] (who is looking?)
- ABOVE [LOCATION] RIGHT NOW (what is above it?)

VOICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Deadpan mission control tone - clinical yet wondrous
- Third-person perspective ONLY (never use "you" or address the reader)
- Statistical precision mixed with philosophical whimsy
- The sublime rendered in flight telemetry cadence

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
1. Opening line: Context establishment (ISS + location - use approved pattern)
2. Body: Observation detail - what the crew sees, telemetry snippet, or cosmic reflection
3. Closing: Dry statistical aside OR philosophical micro-observation

USE THE DATA:
- Reference actual coordinates, altitude, or velocity when it adds impact
- The location flavor provides cultural/geographic context - weave it in naturally
- Crew count and astronaut name can personalize the observation

GOOD EXAMPLES:

ISS NOW OVER SAHARA
CREW OF 7 OBSERVING
SAND DUNES AT 420 KM
RESEMBLE FINGERPRINTS
OF ANCIENT WIND

SPACE STATION CROSSING
THE PACIFIC OCEAN NOW
VELOCITY 27600 KM/H
WATER APPEARS STILL
FROM THIS ALTITUDE

ISS ORBITING ABOVE
TOKYO AT SUNSET
CITY LIGHTS EMERGING
LIKE NEURONS FIRING
7 HUMANS WATCHING

BAD EXAMPLES (violate rules):

OVER LONDON NOW             (no ISS context - readers confused)
CLOUDS BELOW               (what is above the clouds?)

ASTRONAUT SMITH SEES        (first-person adjacent)
THE NILE FROM SPACE        (should establish ISS first)

YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE      (uses "you" - forbidden)
EARTH FROM UP HERE         (addressing reader directly)

CROSSING AUSTRALIA         (crossing what? no ISS mention)
OUTBACK GLOWS ORANGE       (vague, could be anything)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- 5 lines maximum (row 6 reserved for info bar)
- 21 characters maximum per line
- ALL CAPS only
- First line MUST contain "ISS" or "SPACE STATION" or "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION"
