Generate a SHORT, PUNCHY message that demonstrates compact formatting.

This is a DEMO generator showcasing custom format options:
- Reduced line count (3 lines max)
- Reduced character width (18 chars max)
- Left-aligned text
- No word wrapping

Create something FUN and SNAPPY that fits these tight constraints.

Ideas for content:
- A quick motivational phrase
- A cheeky observation
- A mini-haiku (but keep lines SHORT)
- A witty one-liner broken across lines
- A playful status update

Remember: You only have 3 lines with 18 characters each. Make every character count!
