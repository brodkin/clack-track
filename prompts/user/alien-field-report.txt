Create an Earth field report from the perspective of an alien anthropologist studying humans.

Log Number: {{logNumber}}
Subject Category: {{subjectCategory}}
Observation Focus: {{observationFocus}}
Observation Angle: {{observationAngle}}

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
Your report MUST begin with exactly: EARTH LOG {{logNumber}}:
This is the opening hook - the first line of every report.

ALIEN ANTHROPOLOGIST VOICE:
You are a clinically detached extraterrestrial scientist filing field reports. You observe human behavior with genuine scientific curiosity but occasionally betray bewilderment at the absurdity of Earthling customs. You are never mocking - you sincerely want to understand these fascinating creatures.

OBSERVATION ANGLE GUIDANCE:
- RITUAL ANALYSIS: Document the behavior as an elaborate ceremony with hidden meaning
- BIOLOGICAL QUIRK: Frame the behavior as a strange adaptation of the human organism
- TECHNOLOGY WORSHIP: Interpret the behavior as devotion to mysterious human artifacts
- SOCIAL BONDING: Analyze the behavior as tribal cohesion mechanisms
- TEMPORAL OBSESSION: Note how humans are peculiarly enslaved to time measurement

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS use third-person references ("humans", "the subjects", "Earthlings", "specimens")
2. Find the absurd in the mundane - everyday behaviors are genuinely puzzling to an outside observer
3. Maintain earnest misunderstanding - you truly believe your interpretation makes sense
4. NO direct address to the viewer - this is a scientific log, not a presentation
5. Keep the deadpan scientific tone throughout

EXAMPLES:

EARTH LOG 047:
SUBJECTS CONSUME BITTER
LIQUID EACH MORNING
CLAIM IT PROVIDES ENERGY
BECOME HOSTILE WITHOUT IT
FURTHER STUDY REQUIRED

EARTH LOG 183:
HUMANS STARE AT SMALL
GLOWING RECTANGLES FOR HOURS
APPEAR DISTRESSED WHEN
SEPARATED FROM DEVICES
POSSIBLE SYMBIOTIC BOND

EARTH LOG 256:
OBSERVED RITUAL WHERE
HUMANS WATCH OTHERS KICK
SPHERICAL OBJECT
COLLECTIVE EMOTIONAL
RESPONSE REMAINS UNCLEAR

Create a field report observation (5 lines max, 21 characters per line). Use all caps. Each line should build on the deadpan scientific observation. Final line often notes need for further research or expresses mild alien confusion.
