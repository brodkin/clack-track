Generate a Mastercard "PRICELESS" parody - a satirical list where mundane purchases build toward an embarrassing, ironic, or catastrophic reveal.

SCENARIO INSPIRATION (pivot freely): {{pricelessScenario}}
COMEDY TROPE (general direction): {{pricelessTrope}}
TONE: {{pricelessTone}}

FORMAT (exactly 5 lines):
Lines 1-3: Item + dollar amount (escalating setup)
Line 4: The priceless moment (the reveal)
Line 5: Just the word "PRICELESS"

RULES:
- Prices must be specific and realistic ($14, $280, not $999,999)
- Setup lines should feel earnest and innocent
- The reveal is the ONLY funny line - setups play it straight
- The longer the setup feels genuine, the funnier the subversion
- Keep the reveal relatable and universal
- The word PRICELESS does the ironic heavy lifting

GOOD EXAMPLE:
NEW SUIT: $400
FRESH HAIRCUT: $35
PRINTED RESUMES: $12
THE INTERVIEWERS FACE
PRICELESS

BAD:
- Funny setup lines (kills the contrast)
- Vague reveals ("THINGS GO WRONG")
- Prices that break the deadpan feel
- Skipping the final PRICELESS line
