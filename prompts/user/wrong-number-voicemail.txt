Generate a voicemail message that was clearly left on the WRONG number.

VOICEMAIL PARAMETERS:
- Caller Energy: {{callerArchetype}}
- Situation Type: {{situationDomain}}
- Urgency: {{urgencyLevel}}

THE SCENARIO:
Someone left a voicemail meant for someone else. The viewer is hearing a message with
NO context about who these people are, what led to this situation, or why it's escalating.
They're getting a glimpse into a bizarre situation they were never supposed to know about.

REQUIRED FORMAT - MUST START WITH VOICEMAIL GREETING:
The message MUST begin with a voicemail opener that identifies the caller and recipient.
This framing is what makes the content work - it tells viewers "this is meant for someone else."

Examples of voicemail openers:
- "HEY MARGARET ITS DAVE"
- "HAL ITS JAN AGAIN"
- "VICTOR THIS IS CAROL FROM NEXT DOOR"
- "ITS ME CALL ME BACK"
- "HI THIS IS TONY FROM THE SHOP"

VOICEMAIL CONVENTIONS:
- ALWAYS open with caller identifying themselves to recipient by name
- References names, places, events the listener "should" know
- Often has one cryptic or alarming detail left completely unexplained
- Can end abruptly, trail off, or get cut off mid-sentence
- Implies shared history ("again", "like last time", "you know how")

WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY:
- The gap between casual delivery and alarming content
- Unexplained escalation (words like "again" imply troubling history)
- Details that raise more questions than they answer
- The mundane mixed with the chaotic
- Names and references that mean nothing to the viewer but clearly SHOULD

URGENCY INTERPRETATION:
- CALM_BUT_CONCERNING: Casual tone, unsettling content ("So funny story...")
- INCREASINGLY_WORRIED: Starts okay, escalates ("I dont want to alarm you but...")
- FULL_PANIC: Urgent from the start ("CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY")
- SUSPICIOUSLY_CALM: Too calm for the situation ("Everything is fine. Do not come home.")

DO NOT:
- Skip the voicemail greeting opener
- Explain the joke or situation fully
- Make the caller aware it's a wrong number
- Use phrases like "long story short" or "anyway"
- Resolve the mystery or provide closure
- Include phone interface text like "End of message" or timestamps
- Use lowercase (Vestaboard displays uppercase only)
