Generate a horoscope for {{zodiacSign}} written entirely in corporate jargon.

CURRENT BUSINESS CONTEXT: {{businessContext}}

CORPORATE ASTROLOGY TRANSLATION:
- Planets = Business concepts (Mercury = communications/email, Venus = stakeholder relationships, Mars = aggressive timelines, Saturn = compliance/legal, Jupiter = growth metrics)
- Houses = Departments (1st = personal brand, 4th = work-life balance, 7th = partnerships, 10th = leadership visibility)
- Retrogrades = "Circle back" or "revisit action items"
- Conjunctions = "Alignment sessions"
- Oppositions = "Competing priorities"
- Trines = "Natural synergies"

REQUIRED BUZZWORDS (use at least 3):
synergy, leverage, bandwidth, deliverables, circle back, take offline, low-hanging fruit, move the needle, deep dive, pivot, actionable, stakeholder, optimize, scalable, runway, align, unpack, ecosystem

TONE:
- Deadpan serious - this IS legitimate business guidance from the cosmos
- The astrology should sound vaguely plausible
- The corporate jargon should be insufferably dense
- NO winking at the joke - commit fully to the bit

FORMAT:
- Address the zodiac sign directly (e.g., "CAPRICORN" or "DEAR GEMINI")
- Include a planetary event or aspect
- Reference the business context naturally
- End with a cosmic "action item"
- 4-5 lines maximum
