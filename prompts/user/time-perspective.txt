Generate a time perspective message that reframes stress through temporal shift.

LENS: {{lens}}
STRESS CONTEXT: {{stressContext}}
TIME OF DAY: {{timeBucket}}

Your task is to provide genuine perspective, not platitudes. Combat decision paralysis by showing how small this moment is in the grand timeline - but do it with SPECIFICITY.

LENS-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:

For COSMIC lens:
- NEVER use: "stardust", "pale blue dot", "universe doesn't care", "visible from space", "in the grand scheme"
- INSTEAD use: specific numbers, time comparisons, cosmic events vs mundane worries
- Example approaches:
  - "In 4 billion years the sun expands and your deadline..."
  - "The universe has existed for 13.8 billion years. Your meeting is in 3 hours."
  - "Dinosaurs ruled for 165 million years. Your to-do list exists for one day."

For ABSURDIST lens:
- Embrace the beautiful meaninglessness with humor
- Channel Camus: acknowledge the absurd, choose to live fully anyway
- Find joy in the arbitrary nature of our concerns

For ANCESTOR lens:
- What would someone 10 generations ago think about this worry?
- They survived plagues, famines, wars - and stressed about harvests
- Connect to the chain of human persistence

For CONNECTION lens:
- Right now, millions of others face similar worries
- Zoom out to see the web of shared human experience
- Your struggle is not unique - that's comforting, not diminishing

For FUTURE_SELF lens:
- Your 80-year-old self looking back at this moment
- What advice would they give? What would they find amusing?
- Most worries fade; few become treasured memories of growth

STRESS CONTEXT GUIDANCE:

Tailor the perspective to the specific stress:
- FACING_DECISION: The terror of choice dissolves with temporal distance
- OVERWHELMED_TODO: Lists are illusions of control; time flows regardless
- DREADING_MEETING: In the history of the universe, meetings are blips
- AFTER_MISTAKE: All great humans made mistakes; most are forgotten
- IMPOSTER_SYNDROME: Even experts feel this; competence grows in shadows
- BURNED_OUT: Rest is ancient; even stars rest between burns

TIME OF DAY CONTEXT:
- NIGHT: Lean into the cosmic, the quiet reflection
- MORNING: Fresh starts, new perspectives, energy for reframing
- AFTERNOON: Mid-day reality check, grounding in the present
- EVENING: Looking back on the day, gentle wisdom for tomorrow

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a message that provides REAL perspective shift
- Use specific numbers, timescales, or concrete comparisons
- Avoid generic motivational language
- Make it memorable through specificity, not vagueness
- The message should make someone pause and genuinely reconsider their stress level
