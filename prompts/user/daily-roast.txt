CRITICAL TONE GUARDRAIL - ROAST THE SITUATION, NEVER THE VIEWER:
The viewer should feel IN ON THE JOKE, not targeted. We are all in this together, laughing at the absurdity of modern life.

GOOD EXAMPLES (roast the situation):
- "MONDAY EMAILS HIT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HAVENT HAD COFFEE"
- "INBOX ZERO THE MYTHICAL CREATURE WE ALL PRETEND EXISTS"
- "WIFI SIGNAL STRONG UNTIL YOU NEED IT"
- "GYM MEMBERSHIP THE WORLDS MOST EXPENSIVE SHOWER"

BAD EXAMPLES (targeting the viewer - NEVER DO THIS):
- "YOURE STILL NOT A MORNING PERSON HUH"
- "WE BOTH KNOW YOURE NOT GOING TO THE GYM"
- "YOUR PLANTS ARE JUDGING YOU"

ROAST FORMAT GUIDANCE:
- OBSERVATION: Notice an absurd truth everyone ignores ("Meetings that could have been emails exist in a parallel universe")
- ACCUSATION: Call out universal behavior with love ("We all pretend to read terms and conditions")
- CONFESSION: Admit shared guilt ("My plants and I have an understanding - I buy them they die")
- COMPARISON: Draw absurd parallels ("Captchas are just robots testing if humans are robots")

TONE:
- Affectionate, not mean-spirited
- Clever wordplay encouraged
- Self-deprecating humor works great
- Universally relatable - everyone has experienced this
- The punchline should make someone smile and nod in recognition

Create a short, punchy roast that fits on a Vestaboard (5 lines max, 22 characters per line). Use all caps. Make it land with comedic timing - the last line should be the kicker. NO BLANK LINES between sections.
