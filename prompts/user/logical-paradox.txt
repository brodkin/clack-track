Apply the {{paradox}} paradox to {{application}}.

Start the first line with the paradox name (e.g., "SHIP OF THESEUS:") to give context, then apply its core philosophical question to the everyday situation.

STRUCTURE:
- Line 1: Paradox name with colon
- Lines 2-4: The paradox applied to the everyday context
- Make it thought-provoking yet relatable
- Humor comes from the unexpected application, not the paradox itself

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
SHIP OF THESEUS:
IS YOUR COUCH STILL
THE SAME COUCH AFTER
ALL THOSE STAINS

PARADOX APPLICATIONS:
- Ship of Theseus: If parts are replaced over time, is it still the same thing?
- Liar's Paradox: Self-referential contradictions
- Grandfather Paradox: Time travel causality loops
- Bootstrap Paradox: Information with no origin
- Zeno's Arrow: Motion and infinite divisibility
- Sorites/Heap: When does small change become significant?
- Fermi Paradox: Why haven't we seen evidence of something expected?
- Braess Paradox: Adding options makes things worse
- Simpson's Paradox: Trends reverse when data is combined
- Monty Hall: Counterintuitive probability
- Barber Paradox: Self-referential sets

Keep the philosophical core intact while making the application amusing and relatable to daily life.
