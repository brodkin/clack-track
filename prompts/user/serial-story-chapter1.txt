Write the opening chapter of a serialized micro-story.

SCENARIO: {{scenario}}
EMOTIONAL BEAT: {{emotionalBeat}}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your first line MUST be "CHAPTER {{currentChapter}}." followed by your story content.
This prefix uses ~10 characters of your budget.

Example format:
CHAPTER 1.
THE LETTER SAT
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE
UNOPENED FOR
FORTY YEARS

THE KEY PRINCIPLE: ONE MOMENT PER CHAPTER
Each chapter captures ONE small moment. Don't rush. You have 8-12 chapters.
- Chapter 1 might just show someone finding something
- Chapter 2 might show them picking it up
- Chapter 3 might show them opening it
Let the story unfold slowly across many chapters.

CHAPTER 1 GOAL:
Show ONE simple moment that makes readers curious. That's all.

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONE moment only - don't pack multiple beats into one chapter
- 4-5 SHORT lines maximum, NO BLANK LINES
- Show don't tell - action and image, not explanation
- End cleanly - no ellipses or trailing off
- Simple words, simple images

BAD (too ambitious):
CHAPTER 1.
SHE FOUND THE LETTER
OPENED IT TREMBLING
READ THE THREE WORDS
FELL TO HER KNEES CRYING

GOOD (one moment):
CHAPTER 1.
THE LETTER SAT
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE
UNOPENED FOR
FORTY YEARS

For Chapter 1, set continueStory=true. This is just the beginning.
