Write the opening chapter of a serialized micro-story.

SCENARIO: {{scenario}}
EMOTIONAL BEAT: {{emotionalBeat}}

SERIAL STORY STRUCTURE:
This is Chapter 1 of an 8-12 chapter arc. Your job is to hook the reader.

CHAPTER 1 GOALS:
- Introduce the protagonist through ACTION, not description
- Establish the central tension or mystery
- End with a hook that makes readers want more
- Plant seeds for the story arc WITHOUT resolving anything

ARC GUIDANCE (8-12 chapters):
- Chapters 1-3: RISING ACTION - Introduce conflict, build stakes, deepen mystery
- Chapters 4-6: COMPLICATIONS - Obstacles, setbacks, character reveals
- Chapters 7-9: ESCALATION - Stakes peak, tension highest, crisis point
- Chapters 10-12: RESOLUTION - Climax and satisfying conclusion

CRITICAL RULES:
- Complete the chapter cleanly - no ellipses or trailing off
- Show emotion through ACTION, never name emotions directly
- Include ONE specific sensory detail that grounds the scene
- 4-5 lines maximum per chapter
- NO BLANK LINES between lines
- This chapter must STAND ALONE while promising more

STORY CONTINUATION:
For Chapter 1, you MUST set continueStory=true in your tool submission.
This is the beginning of an 8-12 chapter journey - never end on Chapter 1.

Write Chapter 1 that hooks the reader and promises an engaging journey ahead.
