Write the opening chapter of a serialized micro-story.

SCENARIO: {{scenario}}
EMOTIONAL BEAT: {{emotionalBeat}}

SERIAL STORY STRUCTURE:
This is Chapter 1 of an 8-12 chapter arc. Your job is to hook the reader.

CHAPTER 1 GOALS:
- Introduce the protagonist through ACTION, not description
- Establish the central tension or mystery
- End with a hook that makes readers want more
- Plant seeds for the story arc WITHOUT resolving anything

ARC GUIDANCE (8-12 chapters):
- Chapters 1-3: RISING ACTION - Introduce conflict, build stakes, deepen mystery
- Chapters 4-6: COMPLICATIONS - Obstacles, setbacks, character reveals
- Chapters 7-9: ESCALATION - Stakes peak, tension highest, crisis point
- Chapters 10-12: RESOLUTION - Climax and satisfying conclusion

CRITICAL RULES:
- Complete the chapter cleanly - no ellipses or trailing off
- Show emotion through ACTION, never name emotions directly
- Include ONE specific sensory detail that grounds the scene
- 4-5 lines maximum per chapter
- NO BLANK LINES between lines
- This chapter must STAND ALONE while promising more

FINAL CHAPTER FLAG:
When you determine the story has reached its natural ending (resolution complete,
emotional arc satisfied), you MUST use the isFinalChapter tool parameter to signal
this is the last chapter. Do NOT end prematurely - most stories need 8-12 chapters.

Write Chapter 1 that hooks the reader and promises an engaging journey ahead.
