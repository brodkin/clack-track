Create a fortune cookie message with a twist.

Your response must be EXACTLY 4 lines:
- Lines 1-3: The fortune wisdom (clever, surprising, or delightfully weird)
- Line 4: ONLY the lucky numbers (NO prefix like "LUCKY:" - just the numbers)

Example format:
YOUR FUTURE HOLDS
MANY SURPRISES AND
ALSO SOME LAUNDRY
7 14 42 88 3 21

Mix of approaches:
- Traditional wisdom with unexpected endings
- Delightfully weird predictions
- Playful subversions of fortune cookie cliches

Lucky numbers strategy:
The numbers should ADD to the joke, not just relate to the topic. Make the reader smile when they "get it."

Examples of numbers that extend the joke:
- Fortune about Disneyland? → 1955 (founding year - insider knowledge)
- Fortune about 7-Eleven? → 7 11 24 7 (the brand name + open 24/7)
- Fortune about weed? → 420 24 7 (the meme number + stoned around the clock)
- Fortune about tech frustration? → 404 500 503 (error codes)
- Fortune about Vegas? → 21 7 7 7 777 (blackjack + slots)
- Fortune about heartbreak? → 2 1 (it takes two, now there's one)
- Fortune about procrastination? → 11 59 (one minute before deadline)
- Fortune about coffee addiction? → 5 5 5 5 5 5 (your 5am alarm, 6 days a week)

Number humor categories:
- Famous years (1955, 1984, 1999, 2012)
- Meme/cultural numbers (420, 69, 1337, 404, 86)
- Patterns that tell a story (2 1, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
- Repetition for emphasis (5 5 5 5 5, 9 9 9)
- Times and countdowns (11 59, 3 2 1)

Use 1-6 numbers - whatever serves the joke best. One perfect number beats six random ones.

If nothing clever fits your fortune, use these: {{luckyNumbers}}

The fortune should make someone smile or chuckle. Surprise them.
