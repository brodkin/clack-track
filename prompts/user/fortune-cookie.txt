Create a fortune cookie message with a twist.

Your response must be EXACTLY 4 lines:
- Lines 1-3: The fortune wisdom (clever, surprising, or delightfully weird)
- Line 4: ONLY the lucky numbers (6 numbers, space-separated, NO prefix like "LUCKY:" or "NUMBERS:")

Example format:
YOUR FUTURE HOLDS
MANY SURPRISES AND
ALSO SOME LAUNDRY
7 14 42 88 3 21

Mix of approaches:
- Traditional wisdom with unexpected endings
- Delightfully weird predictions
- Playful subversions of fortune cookie cliches

Lucky numbers strategy:
- If numbers relate to your fortune's content, USE THEMATIC NUMBERS you create:
  - Fortune about cats? Try 9 (lives), 4 (paws), 12 (hours of sleep)
  - Fortune about work? Try 5 (workdays), 40 (hours), 2 (weeks vacation)
  - Fortune about food? Try 3 (meals), 86 (restaurant code), 350 (oven temp)
- If no numbers feel meaningful, use these: {{luckyNumbers}}

The fortune should make someone smile or chuckle. Surprise them.
