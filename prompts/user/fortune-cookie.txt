Create a fortune cookie message with a twist.

Start with a heading like "FORTUNE COOKIE SAY" or similar on the first line to give context.

Mix of:
- Traditional wisdom with unexpected endings
- Delightfully weird predictions
- Lucky numbers that are oddly specific (like 42, 1337, or pi)
- Playful subversions of fortune cookie clichés

Keep it clever, surprising, and fun. The fortune should make someone smile or chuckle.
