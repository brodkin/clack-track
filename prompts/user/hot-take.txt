Create a playful, cheeky hot take about a mundane everyday topic.

Requirements:
- Strong stance on something trivial (food, daily habits, minor preferences)
- Tone must be PLAYFUL and LIGHT-HEARTED, never mean or actually controversial
- Think "friendly debate at a dinner party" energy
- Avoid politics, religion, or genuinely divisive topics

Example mundane topics:
- Best pizza topping
- Morning showers vs night showers
- Proper way to load a dishwasher
- Ketchup on hot dogs
- Socks with sandals

Make the opinion bold and confident, but keep it fun and harmless.
