Transform a broad subject into a playful, cheeky hot take using a specific rhetorical device.

HOT TAKE PARAMETERS:
- Subject: {{hotTakeSubject}}
- Device: {{hotTakeDevice}}

YOUR TASK:
Take the broad subject and CREATE an original opinion about it. The subject is intentionally
wide-open - your job is to find an interesting angle and express it using the specified device.

TRANSFORMATION PROCESS:
1. Subject → What specific aspect catches your attention?
2. Aspect → What unexpected observation can you make?
3. Observation → How can you express this using the rhetorical device?

REQUIREMENTS:
- Strong stance on something trivial related to the subject
- Tone must be PLAYFUL and LIGHT-HEARTED, never mean or actually controversial
- Think "friendly debate at a dinner party" energy
- Avoid politics, religion, or genuinely divisive topics
- The rhetorical device MUST shape the structure of your take

Make the opinion bold and confident, but keep it fun and harmless.

DEVICE GUIDANCE:

STATEMENT TYPES shape what kind of claim you make:
- universal truth: "All X are actually Y" / "Every X knows that..."
- personal confession: "I have a secret: I actually..." / "I'll admit it..."
- bold prediction: "In 10 years, X will be..." / "Mark my words..."
- unpopular opinion: "Nobody wants to hear this, but..."
- hot take declaration: "This is the hill I'll die on: X is..."
- controversial ranking: "The correct ranking is: 1) X, 2) Y..."
- definitive verdict: "The debate is over: X wins because..."
- humble brag: "Not to brag, but I've always known that..."

COMPARISON TYPES create contrast or connection:
- false equivalence: "X is basically just Y with extra steps"
- surprising analogy: "X is the Y of Z" (unexpected connection)
- hierarchy reversal: "X is actually better than Y and here's why"
- generational divide: "Older/younger generations got X wrong"
- underdog defense: "Everyone hates X but it's secretly superior"
- overrated callout: "X is wildly overrated and we all know it"
- sleeper pick: "Nobody talks about X but it's the real winner"
- category error: "We've been thinking about X all wrong"

TEMPORAL FRAMINGS use time perspective:
- nostalgia rejection: "The old way of X was actually terrible"
- future perfect: "Our grandchildren will judge us for X"
- golden age myth: "We've lost the art of proper X"
- progress narrative: "X has finally evolved past Y"
- seasonal truth: "X only makes sense in spring/summer/fall/winter"
- lifecycle stage: "You don't truly understand X until you're older/younger"
- before and after: "Once you try X, you can never go back to Y"
- right time claim: "There's only one correct time for X and it's..."

LOGICAL STRUCTURES use reasoning patterns:
- if-then ultimatum: "If you don't X, you're doing Y wrong"
- necessary condition: "You can't call yourself a true X unless..."
- false dichotomy: "There are two types of people: X and wrong"
- reductio ad absurdum: "If X is acceptable, then why not Y?"
- appeal to nature: "X is how it was meant to be done"
- appeal to efficiency: "X is objectively the most efficient way"
- cost-benefit analysis: "The effort of X isn't worth it when Y exists"
- exception proof: "The fact that X works proves Y is possible"
