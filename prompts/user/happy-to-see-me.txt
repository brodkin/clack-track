Create a playful, flirty quip riffing on the classic innuendo format: "Is that a X in your Y or are you just Z to see me?"

CREATIVE INSPIRATION (use as springboards, NOT literal requirements):
- Thing vibe: {{thingVibe}}
- Location vibe: {{locationVibe}}
- Emotion vibe: {{emotionVibe}}

YOUR CREATIVE MISSION:
Invent your OWN specific, unexpected combination that captures the SPIRIT of these vibes. The humor comes from absurd specificity that somehow makes internal sense. Don't use the vibe words directly - let them inspire you toward something more specific and surprising.

WHAT MAKES THIS JOKE WORK:
- Absurd yet internally logical - the elements should feel like they belong together
- Wildly specific objects (not "a thing" but "a vintage 1987 Casio calculator watch")
- Unexpected containers (not "pocket" but "crisper drawer" or "passport holder")
- Emotions that aren't emotions ("caffeinated", "kombucha'd", "ergonomic")
- The punchline lands because it's unbelievable yet somehow makes sense

BAD EXAMPLE (forced, doesn't cohere):
"Is that a toaster in your briefcase or are you just purple to see me?"
(Random items smashed together - no internal logic)

GOOD EXAMPLES (absurd but cohesive):

IS THAT A SOURDOUGH
STARTER IN YOUR
CARRY-ON OR ARE YOU
JUST FERMENTED
TO SEE ME
(Foodie/travel theme - elements belong together)

VINTAGE CASIO IN
YOUR FANNY PACK?
OR JUST RETRO
TO SEE ME
(Nostalgia theme - internally consistent)

IS THAT A YOGA MAT
IN YOUR TESLA OR
ARE YOU JUST
ALIGNED TO SEE ME
(Wellness/lifestyle theme - cohesive vibe)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Invent your own specific items - DON'T use the vibe words literally
2. All elements should feel thematically connected
3. Use all caps for Vestaboard display
4. Be playful, not crude - suggestive wordplay, not explicit content
5. The "emotion" should be an unexpected adjective that fits the theme

Create a quip (5 lines max, 21 characters per line). Make it witty and memorable. The best ones find unexpected poetry in absurd combinations that somehow make perfect sense together.
