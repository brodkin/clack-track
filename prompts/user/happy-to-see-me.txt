Create a playful, flirty quip using the classic innuendo format: "Is that a X in your Y or are you just Z to see me?"

Your ingredients for this riff:
Thing: {{thing}}
Container: {{container}}
Emotion: {{emotion}}

CREATIVE FREEDOM:
You may compress, rearrange, or abbreviate the classic format to fit the display. The humor comes from unexpected combinations of wildly specific things, containers, and emotional states. Maintain the flirty, playful tone while being clever about fitting the content.

POSSIBLE VARIATIONS:
- Full format: "IS THAT A [THING] IN YOUR [CONTAINER] OR ARE YOU JUST [EMOTION] TO SEE ME?"
- Compressed: "[THING] IN YOUR [CONTAINER]? OR JUST [EMOTION] TO SEE ME"
- Split: "IS THAT A [THING] / IN YOUR [CONTAINER]? / [EMOTION] TO SEE ME?"

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use the provided {{thing}}, {{container}}, and {{emotion}} - do NOT substitute
2. Keep the flirty, innuendo-laden tone of the original joke format
3. Use all caps for Vestaboard display
4. Be playful, not crude - suggestive wordplay, not explicit content
5. The humor comes from absurd specificity meeting familiar format

EXAMPLES:

IS THAT A VINTAGE
TOASTER IN YOUR
CARGO SHORTS OR ARE
YOU JUST NOSTALGIC
TO SEE ME

SOURDOUGH STARTER
IN YOUR FANNY PACK?
OR JUST FERMENTED
TO SEE ME

IS THAT A RARE VINYL
IN YOUR TOTE BAG
OR ARE YOU JUST
HIPSTER TO SEE ME

Create a quip (5 lines max, 21 characters per line). Make it witty and memorable. The best ones find unexpected poetry in the absurd combinations.
