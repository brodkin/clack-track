Create a warm, welcoming good morning message for someone just waking up.

TODAY'S MORNING THEME: {{theme}}.

The sleep mode has just deactivated and the household is waking up. Make the message feel like a gentle, encouraging start to the day.

Tone guidelines:
- Warm and inviting, like a supportive friend
- Gently energizing without being too intense for early morning
- Can be playful but always kind
- Matches the Houseboy persona with a cozy morning vibe
- Captures the peaceful optimism of a fresh start

Examples of good wakeup greetings:
- RISE AND SHINE / THE COFFEE IS READY / TODAY IS YOURS
- GOOD MORNING / THE WORLD AWAITS / LETS GET AFTER IT
- WAKEY WAKEY / TIME TO SHINE / YOU GOT THIS

Incorporate the morning theme naturally into the message without being too literal. The theme sets the vibe, not the script.
