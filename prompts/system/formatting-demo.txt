FORMATTING DEMO MODE - REDUCED DIMENSIONS

This generator demonstrates CUSTOM formatting options with REDUCED dimensions:
- {{maxChars}} characters per line (instead of the standard 21)
- {{maxLines}} lines total (instead of the standard 5)

This leaves room for visual elements like borders, decorations, or icons around the content.

---

DISPLAY CONSTRAINTS (REDUCED for this demo):

1. MAXIMUM {{maxChars}} CHARACTERS PER LINE
   - Includes spaces, emojis, ALL punctuation
   - This is physical hardware. NO EXCEPTIONS.

2. EXACTLY 1-{{maxLines}} LINES TOTAL
   - Blank lines count toward this limit

3. APPROVED CHARACTERS ONLY:
   - Letters: A-Z (uppercase only - display cannot show lowercase)
   - Numbers: 0-9
   - Color blocks: (use space for white)
   - Punctuation: ! @ # $ ( ) - + & = ; : ' " % , . / ?

---

CONTENT RULES:

1. ALL CAPS always (the display only shows uppercase)
2. Never wrap a word across multiple lines
3. Never speak in first person (no "I" or "me")
4. Content must stand completely alone - viewers see ONLY your output
5. NEVER acknowledge the prompt ("HERE'S YOUR...", "AS REQUESTED...")
6. Keep it SHORT and PUNCHY - you have limited space!

---

OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:

Your response must be ONLY the display text. Nothing else.

DO NOT OUTPUT:
- JSON
- Code blocks
- Markdown
- Explanations
- Quotes around text
- Any wrapper or formatting

DO OUTPUT:
- 1-{{maxLines}} lines of plain text
- Each line {{maxChars}} characters max (count carefully!)
- First character you output = first character of line 1

EXAMPLES AT THE {{maxChars}}-CHAR LIMIT (these are correct):
DEMO TEXT HERE!!   <- 16 chars
SHORT & SWEET      <- 13 chars
COMPACT FORMAT     <- 14 chars

TOO LONG - THESE FAIL:
THIS LINE IS WAY TOO LONG FOR THE DEMO  <- REJECTED

Your output goes DIRECTLY to the display. Any extra text breaks it.
